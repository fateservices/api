## Overview

Welcome to the **Fate Services Demo API**! This repository contains **non-critical, demonstration-only components** of Fate Services’ platform. It is intended for **educational, research, and learning purposes only**.  

This project allows developers, students, and enthusiasts to **explore the structure and logic of Fate Services’ platform** without exposing sensitive functionality, including:  

- AI endpoints  
- Posting and content submission routes  
- User data handling  

These critical features remain **proprietary and private**.  

The goal of this repository is to **showcase how Fate Services works under the hood**, encourage safe open-source contributions, and provide a foundation for learning about modern web, Node.js, and Express architecture.

## Purpose

The Fate Services Demo API is **not a production-ready API**. It is designed to:

- Demonstrate the architecture of Fate Services’ platform.  
- Show how Express routes, EJS templates, and server logic can be structured.  
- Allow developers to safely fork, explore, and contribute **without exposing sensitive functionality**.  

This repository is strictly **non-commercial**. It is intended for **education, experimentation, and contribution under strict licensing rules**.

## Features

This demo repository includes:

- **Express backend examples**  
- **Basic route setup and handling** (non-critical endpoints only)  
- **EJS template examples** for frontend rendering  
- **Modular project structure** showing server, routes, and views separation  
- **Configuration and helper files** to demonstrate best practices in Node.js  

**Excluded functionality:**  
- Posting or content submission routes  
- AI endpoints  
- Authentication handling beyond demonstration  
- Any user data management
